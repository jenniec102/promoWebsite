      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>Charlie wants to experience something new for herself. Xiomara wants help in supporting the family. Popo just wants to help. Three women. Three different generations. Ai follows an intergenerational Chinese-Venezuelan family struggling to stay together when Charlie asks Xiomara if she can go abroad.</p>

    <!--(Block of text) Quotations from the Director -->
    <div class="blurb">
      <h2>From the Director</h2>
      <p>I decided that this would be a story that would serve as a love letter to my mother and everyone who has supported me all this time.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We haven’t seen a mother-daughter story that showed the parent’s perspective at the same time. In Ai, I want to properly portray both perspectives so that there is no antagonist. I want to show a Chinese-Venezuelan single-parent household simply living life and trying to achieve their American dream. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I strive to tell stories that portray people realistically, responsibly, and as humanly possible. I believe in showing people in real life doing real things, simply living, and being human. As a Chinese-Latina female director, I make an effort to craft stories that center strong female leads going through various situations such as mental health or identity issues so that audience members can feel less alone when seeing someone face similar issues to themselves on screen. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I want to champion unheard voices and stories, and Ai is one of them - a story of a single mother and her daughter as they navigate a seemingly simple issue when Charlie asks to go abroad. </p>

      <h2>Fundraising</h2>
      <h3>Ai(Love) is currently fundraising to make this film into a reality.</h3>
      <p>Your contribution to this film is not only helping more AAPI and POC projects have their voices heard, but also answering a question so many of us face: when you are between two worlds, two generations, two decisions - what do you do? We aim to continue the conversation about this subject, and especially the blending of cultures that’s become more and more common these days. No matter who you are, we can all relate to wanting to chase our dreams and being unsure about how to go about doing so. </p>
